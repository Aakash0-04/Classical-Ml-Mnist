# Classical ML on MNIST

This project demonstrates how to use **classical machine learning algorithms** to classify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.

The implementation is done in a Jupyter Notebook using Python and scikit-learn.

## 🔄 How the Project Works

1. Load the MNIST dataset
2. Flatten 28×28 images into feature vectors
3. Split data into training and testing sets
4. Train classical ML models
5. Predict labels (`y_hat`) on test data
6. Evaluate models using accuracy and confusion matrix
7. Compare results visually
